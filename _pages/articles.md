The statistics are alarming: the pandemic has had disastrous repercussions on children’s safety online. Young people are more connected and accessible than ever, making them easy targets for online sexual predators. Detecting the “grooming” of children online has thus become essential for protecting them.

Explosion des mises en chantier. Acquisitions en série – et parfois sous le radar – par des fonds torontois, des fortunes familiales québécoises et de nouveaux groupes montréalais. Hausse effrénée des prix. Alors que l’habitation a pris une place centrale dans les campagnes électorales municipales, La Presse dresse un portrait inédit de la frénésie qui s’est emparée du marché immobilier locatif de la province.

Men – especially young men – are slower to get vaccinated against COVID-19 than women. Men are also slower to get tested, and a greater number of them end up in intensive care after being infected by the virus. “Women are always better vaccinated than men,” said Ève Dubé, researcher at the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ).

MONTREAL - Quebec’s decision to promote administering a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine to as many people as possible could explain why Quebec lags other provinces in administering second doses. While the province’s strategy worked so far, the arrival of the Delta variant is an incentive to step up the pace.

MONTREAL - If vaccination against COVID-19 were a race, Montreal’s boroughs and municipalities would all have a different starting point. In the West Island, the start is a few metres from the finish line, with an aging, higher-income population. In the north, with a higher percentage of lower-income residents and immigrants, the race would be more like an obstacle course.

MONTREAL - The enthusiasm for Montreal’s new Réseau express vélo (REV) bicycle network has been confirmed by data collected on bike paths around the city and analysed by La Presse. The number of cyclists on the main north-south axis of the network, along Saint-Denis, Berri and Lajeunesse streets, is nearing the levels observed on Clark and Saint-Dominique streets, previously the most popular north-south axes.
